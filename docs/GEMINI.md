# Project Overview

This project is a full-stack e-commerce application called YEGA. It consists of a Node.js backend and a React frontend. The application appears to be a platform that connects customers with shops, with functionality for delivery people and administrators.

## Main Technologies

### Backend

*   **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
*   **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js.
*   **MongoDB:** NoSQL database.
*   **Mongoose:** ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.
*   **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** For user authentication.
*   **Bcrypt:** For password hashing.

### Frontend

*   **React:** The core of the application.
*   **react-bootstrap:** For UI components and responsive design.
*   **styled-components:** for custom styling.
*   **react-hook-form:** Used in the `Tienda` component for form management.
*   **react-leaflet:** Used in the `Repartidor` component to display a map.
*   **react-table:** Used in the `Administrador` component for displaying a table with pagination and filtering.
*   **axios:** Used for making HTTP requests to a backend API.

## Architecture

The project is divided into two main parts: a `backend` and a `frontend`.

### Backend

The backend follows a standard Model-View-Controller (MVC) like architecture, with:

*   **`models/`:** Contains the Mongoose schemas and models for the database collections (e.g., `Producto.js`).
*   **`routes/`:** Defines the API endpoints and their corresponding logic (e.g., `productosList.js`, `usuariosLogin.js`).

There are also scripts for code generation (`generate-backend.js`, `generate-endpoint.js`), which suggests a convention of using these tools to scaffold new features.

### Frontend

The frontend is a React application with a component-based architecture. The code is structured by user roles, with each role having its own component in the `src/pages` directory:

*   `Cliente.js`: For customers.
*   `Tienda.js`: For shops/vendors.
*   `Repartidor.js`: For delivery people.
*   `Administrador.js`: For administrators.

The components are generated by a script (`generate-frontend-tasks.js`) that uses a Blackbox AI API. All components use `react-bootstrap` for layout and `styled-components` for custom styling.

# Building and Running

The project does not have `package.json` files in the root, backend, or frontend directories, so the exact commands for building and running the project are not explicitly defined. However, based on the file contents, the following commands are likely to be used:

## Backend

**Installation:**

```bash
# TODO: Create a package.json file and add dependencies.
cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose jsonwebtoken bcrypt
```

**Running the application:**

```bash
# TODO: Create a main server file (e.g., index.js or app.js)
node index.js
```

## Frontend

**Installation:**

```bash
# TODO: Create a package.json file and add dependencies.
cd frontend
npm init -y
npm install react react-dom react-bootstrap bootstrap styled-components react-hook-form react-leaflet leaflet react-table axios
```

**Running the project:**

There is no information on how to run the project. A typical command would be:

```bash
npm start
```

**NOTE:** Without `package.json` files, these commands are just suggestions.

# Development Conventions

*   **Code Generation:** The project relies heavily on AI-powered code generation scripts (`generate-backend.js`, `generate-frontend-tasks.js`, `generate-endpoint.js`). It is recommended to use these scripts to maintain consistency when adding new features.
*   **Styling:** The frontend uses `styled-components` with a defined color palette (black background, white text, silver and gold accents).
*   **Mock Data:** The frontend components currently use mock data defined directly in the files. This will need to be replaced with API calls to the backend.
*   **Authentication:** The backend uses JWT for authentication. The frontend will need to implement logic to handle tokens.
*   **API Design:** The backend API is designed to be RESTful.
