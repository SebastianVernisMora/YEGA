# Project Overview

This project is a React-based frontend application. It appears to be a dashboard with different views for different user roles: `Cliente` (Customer), `Tienda` (Shop), `Repartidor` (Delivery Person), and `Administrador` (Administrator).

The components are generated by a script (`generate-frontend-tasks.js`) that uses a Blackbox AI API. All components use `react-bootstrap` for layout and `styled-components` for custom styling.

## Key Technologies

*   **React:** The core of the application.
*   **react-bootstrap:** For UI components and responsive design.
*   **styled-components:** for custom styling.
*   **react-hook-form:** Used in the `Tienda` component for form management.
*   **react-leaflet:** Used in the `Repartidor` component to display a map.
*   **react-table:** Used in the `Administrador` component for displaying a table with pagination and filtering.
*   **axios:** Used for making HTTP requests to a backend API.

# Building and Running

The project seems to be a standard React application. However, there is no `package.json` file, which is unusual. Based on the file contents, the following commands would be used to install dependencies and run the project.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install react react-dom react-bootstrap bootstrap styled-components react-hook-form react-leaflet leaflet react-table axios
```

**Running the project:**

There is no information on how to run the project. A typical command would be:

```bash
npm start
```

**NOTE:** Without a `package.json` file, these commands are just suggestions.

# Development Conventions

*   The code is structured by user roles, with each role having its own component in the `src/pages` directory.
*   The components are generated by an AI, and they all have a similar structure.
*   The styling is done using `styled-components`, with a defined color palette.
*   The components use mock data, which is defined directly in the component files.
*   The components include instructions on how to use them.
