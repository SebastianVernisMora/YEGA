# Implementation Plan for Frontend Design

## Requirements
1. **Design Implementation**: Implement the frontend design based on the provided Figma design.
2. **Dependencies**: Ensure necessary libraries (React, Tailwind CSS, etc.) are set up.
3. **Assets**: Add any images or icons from the Figma design to the `public` directory.
4. **API Keys**: Verify if any external APIs are needed and ensure API keys are available.

## Steps
1. **Review Figma Design**: Analyze the Figma design to identify components and layouts.
2. **Create Components**: 
   - Implement reusable components in `src/components/ui/`.
   - Ensure components are styled using Tailwind CSS.
3. **Integrate Assets**: 
   - Download and add images/icons to the `public` directory.
4. **Testing**: 
   - Write tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
5. **Deployment**: 
   - Prepare the application for deployment after testing.

## Follow-up Steps
- Install any additional dependencies if required.
- Run the development server to verify the implementation.
